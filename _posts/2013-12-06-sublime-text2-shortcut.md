A lot of blogs say that the shortcut for exchanging 2 adjacent lines is "ctrl+alt+↑", that's not true, this combination can let you edit several lines at the same time. 

The correct combination is shift+ctrl+↑ or ↓. Besides, you may select 2 parts of the code (pressing ctrl when selecting the second part), and press "ctrl+T" to swap the position of the 2 parts that you selected.
