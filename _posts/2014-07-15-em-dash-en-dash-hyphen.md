An **em-dash** is typically used to act as a comma or parenthesis to separate out phrases—or even just a word—in a sentence for various reasons (i.e. an appositive). Examples where an em-dash should be used:

* School is based on the three R’s—reading, writing, and ’rithemtic.
* Against all odds, Pete—the unluckiest man alive—won the lottery.
* I sense something; a presence I've not felt since—

An **en-dash** is used to connect values in a range or that are related. A good rule is to use it when you're expressing a "to" relationship. Examples where an en-dash should be used:

* in years 1939–1945
* pages 31–32 may be relevant
* New York beat Los Angeles 98–95
* When American English would use an em-dash – following [British and Canadian conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash#En_dash_versus_em_dash).

A **hyphen** is used to join words in a compound construction, or separate syllables of a word, like during a line break, or (self-evidently) a hyphenated name.

* pro-American
* cruelty-free eggs
* em-dash
* it's pronounced hos-pi-tal-it-tee
* Olivia Newton-John

Finally, a **minus sign** is distinct from all three of the above.

* 4 − 2 = 2.

If you want to use the correct dash or hyphen in StackExchange comments, just use the appropriate HTML entity: `&mdash;` for em-dash, `&ndash;` for en-dash, and `&minus;` for the minus sign. The hyphen is, of course, on directly your keyboard.
