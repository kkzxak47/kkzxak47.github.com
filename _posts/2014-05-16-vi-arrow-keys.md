This is a frequently asked question.
I did not understand the reason until just now.
It's simple:
    The traditional vi editor doesn't recognize the arrow keys (...afair). There are two solutions:

        1. use vim instead of vi
        2. use h, j, k and l to navigate (you can't navigate while editing on the traditional vi btw.)
I've read this before, but somehow it slipped my mind everytime I tried to use vi and immediately installed vim to replace it.
